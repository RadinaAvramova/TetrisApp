# Tetris App
Welcome to the Tetris App! This application brings the classic game of Tetris to your device, allowing you to experience the timeless fun and challenge of clearing lines and stacking blocks. Whether you're a Tetris aficionado or new to the game, the Tetris App offers an exciting and addictive gaming experience. This README will guide you through the installation, features, and usage of the Tetris App.

## Installation

## Features
The Tetris App offers the following features:

**Classic Gameplay:** Enjoy the iconic gameplay of Tetris, where you manipulate falling blocks (tetrominoes) to create complete horizontal lines and clear them from the screen.

**Customization Options:** Customize the game settings, such as block colors, background themes, control schemes, and difficulty levels, to tailor the gameplay experience to your preferences.

**High Scores and Leaderboards:** Compete for high scores and track your progress on local leaderboards or online leaderboards, challenging yourself to beat your personal best and climb the rankings.

## Usage

1. **Start a New Game:** Launch the Tetris App and choose a game mode to start a new game. Select your preferred settings and options before beginning the game.

2. **Control the Blocks:** Use the arrow keys, touchscreen controls, or on-screen buttons to move, rotate, and drop the falling blocks as they descend from the top of the screen.

3. **Clear Lines:** Arrange the falling blocks to create complete horizontal lines across the playfield. When a line is complete, it will disappear, and you'll earn points for clearing it.

4. **Avoid Game Over:** Keep the stack of blocks from reaching the top of the screen. If the stack reaches the top, the game ends, and your score is recorded.

5. **Achieve High Scores:** Aim to score as many points as possible by clearing lines quickly and efficiently. Strategize your moves to create combos and chains for higher scores.
